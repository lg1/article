\subsubsection{Materials}
	\label{sec:specimen_preparation_electrospinning}


PCL(polycaprolactone, Sigma 65,000 MW) was dissolved in hexafluorisopropanol at 5\%concentration.  
Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was prepared by the thorough mixing of two liquid components (purchased from Dow Corning Toray Corp., Japan) at a ratio of 1:10 in a flat Petri dish. After being kept at 80\gc\space for 1 hour, the polymerized PDMS layer was separated from the dish, cut into 15x15 mm squares.

All chemicals were purchased from Wako Chemicals Inc.,Japan.
\subsubsection{Electrospinning of PCL fibers}
The prepared solution of PCL polymer was using Nanon electrospinning setup(MECC CO.,LTD). The solution was ejected through 20 gauge blut-tip needle at feed rate of 1 ml/h. Either PDMS sheets or 22mm diameter cover glass(Corning Corp.) were placed on the surface of grounded stationary collector, representing a huge metal plate.    
\subsubsection{Creating of randomly orientated nanofibrous substrates }
In order to obtain samples of different nanofibers positioning density we varied spraying time in the range of 10 to 60 seconds.
